## 🧠 Project Overview
This project investigates the relationship between **trader behavior** on the Hyperliquid platform and the **Crypto Fear & Greed Index**, which represents market sentiment.  
The goal is to determine how trading volume, profitability, and risk-taking behavior (through Start Position as a leverage proxy) change between *Fear* and *Greed* periods.

Through data cleaning, analysis, and visualization, this project identifies behavioral patterns that can be used by PrimeTrade.ai for developing sentiment-driven trading insights.
